This applicaiton is a Django based discussion board website built using the tutorial Vitor Freitas on his website https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/, under the series section: https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/

I have branded the applicaiton for use with my company's civil engineering company to use hence the name Pool Engineering, Inc. Discussion Board, or PEI Discussion Board for short.

I have finished most of the code based on the tutorial, howvere I still need to do a few things listed below:
1. I would like to add an avatar upload feature for the user profiles. The tutorial used Gravatar but I couldn;t get that to work, presumabley because I am using the newer version of Django.
2. I would like t deploy the applicaiton to a local web server on our LAN that is running IIS. Not sure yet how to do that.

Thanks you for rading.
P.S. Please excuse any deviatiosn from normal repository ettiquet or rctaice as this is my first project commit.
